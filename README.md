# GeneticAlgorithm-for-function-optimization

Genetic Algorithm with Roulette Wheel Selection, one crossing point and mutation

Function for optimization(you can change it as you wish):
      f(x1,x2) = x1^2 + x2
      
Values that have been used(you can choose whatever value it suits for your problem):
      population_size = 20
      iterations(generations) = 10000
      mutation_rate = 0.1
      crossover_rate = 0.6
